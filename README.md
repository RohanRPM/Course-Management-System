# Course Management System

This C language mini project implements a Course Management System using various data structures and algorithms concepts, including AVL trees. It allows efficient management of courses, students, and classrooms by enabling dynamic addition, deletion, and balancing operations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Management**: Add, delete, and balance courses and students dynamically.
- **Slot Organization**: Organize students into courses based on available slots, handling clashes efficiently.
- **AVL Tree**: Utilize AVL trees to maintain balanced data structures for optimal performance.
- **Real-world Application**: Demonstrates fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms applied to a practical scenario.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source files using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
4. Run the executable file generated after compilation.
